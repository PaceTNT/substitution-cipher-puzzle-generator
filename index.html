                        It generates a simple puzzle for use in roleplaying games based on your inputs.
                        <br><br>
                        You provide an input phrase, optionally specifying "disallowed letters" (to make solving harder) and a "shift" (to offset which glyphs are used). When you click "submit" it 
                        displays an encoding of the input phrase and a set of pictograms that contain the letters needed to decode the input.

                    Do you have any advice or examples?

                <div id="collapseThree" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#accordionExample">

                    Yes!
                    <li> I like making the input phrase a riddle (so players first need to decode the phrase, then solve the riddle).</li>
                    <li> However, don't make the riddle too difficult, and make sure you have a backup plan for how to provide hints if the players get stuck.</li>
                    <li> Conversely, don't make it too easy. Consider the order in which you provide the pictograms. Once you get a few key letters, it quickly becomes a game of "Wheel of Fortune", and you might not need the other pictograms to decode it.
                    (this is where using "disallowed letters" can help). However, if someone is great at word games, this can give them a nice opportunity to show off and have fun... so that's a good outcome too.</li>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Example:</strong> Characters are exploring a forgotten temple to a no-longer-worshipped god of Luck and Death, and find a stone door with no obvious opening mechanism. The door has a riddle engraved on it:
                    <li> Brought to the table </li>
                    <li> Cut and served</li>
                    <li> Never eaten</li>
                    ... with the answer being "cards".<br>
                    If the players had gotten stuck, the intent was to remind them of the decor related to games of chance with death on the line. In a worst-case scenario, one of the games depicted would feature a deck of cards.<br>
                    Once the characters answer the riddle, the stone door extrudes a shelf that holds a deck of playing cards with a set of card-sized depressions alongside. Each depression contains a carving of one of the characters.
                    The characters get the overwhelming sensation that they must each draw at least one card from the deck and place it in the depression to open the door. 
                    In this specific case (a one-shot adventure)... it was a <a href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Deck%20of%20Many%20Things#content">Deck of Many Things</a>, leaving the possibility that things could go truly, horribly wrong. :)
